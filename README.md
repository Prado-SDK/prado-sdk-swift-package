# Prado iOS SDK

Prado iOS SDK for Swift Package Manager.

## Installation

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code. It’s integrated with the Swift build system to automate the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies.

To integrate the Prado SDK into your Xcode project using Swift Package Manager:

1. Add it to the `dependencies` of your `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/Prado-SDK/core-sdk-swift-package.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "10.0.0"))
]
```

2. Enable the `-ObjC` flag in Xcode: click on your project settings, go to **Build Settings**, search for **Other Linker Flags** and add `-ObjC`.

Check out our integration [docs](https://github.com/Prado-SDK/Prado-mobile-sdk) for more info on getting started with the Prado SDK.

Note, this Swift package only includes the main Prado SDK.
